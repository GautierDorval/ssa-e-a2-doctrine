# Semantic schema index (declarative inventory)

This layer defines a non-transactional inventory of critical pages and their declared schema roles.

It is a *declarative map* (what is asserted), not a semantic authority layer (what must be inferred).

## Artifact : semantic-schema-index.jsonld

Purpose :
- Provide a lightweight, machine-readable list of critical pages and their intended schema roles (e.g., Article, Service, CollectionPage, Product).

Constraints :
- No transactional claims.
- No inference about pricing, availability, diagnostics, or contractual commitments.
- The index complements SSA-E and Dual Web; it does not override them.
