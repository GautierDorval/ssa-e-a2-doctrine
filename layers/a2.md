# A2 layer

## Role

A2 provides:
- intent routing (how to interpret a question)
- clustering (stabilize answer patterns)
- observation artifacts (how interpretation behaves over time)

## Constraints

A2 must be strictly non-transactional.
A2 must not include:
- pricing
- availability
- guarantees
- endorsements
- contractual commitments

A2 must not override SSA-E.

A2 does not replace grounding. It routes and constrains interpretation.
