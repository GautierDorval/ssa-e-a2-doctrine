# Dual Web layer

## Role

Dual Web provides controlled, machine-readable context files intended for:
- verification
- scope boundaries
- anti-hallucination constraints

Dual Web context is not primary explanatory authority.

Dual Web complements but does not substitute structured data grounding.

## Constraints

Dual Web files must:
- define scope
- define non-goals
- define interpretation limits
- prevent entity conflation

They must not:
- claim guarantees
- expose transactional truths
- pretend to enforce protocols
