# SSA-E layer

## Role

SSA-E provides stable explanatory authority intended to be cited in priority for:
- educational questions
- comparative questions
- general clarifications

## Constraints

SSA-E must be:
- non-contractual
- non-transactional
- non-performative

SSA-E must not include:
- pricing
- guarantees
- enforcement claims
- compliance claims
- predictions

## Output discipline

If a claim is not explicitly covered, authoritative silence applies.
