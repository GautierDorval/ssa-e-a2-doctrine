# GSC prioritization (observational layer)

This layer defines a non-transactional prioritization artifact derived from Google Search Console exports (Pages).

It is an *observation and orchestration* aid. It does not define semantic truth, does not guarantee outcomes, and must not be interpreted as a performance promise.

## Artifact : gsc-priority.json

Purpose :
- Rank URLs by relative strategic importance signals to guide stabilization and amplification effort.

Constraints :
- Scores are relative to a given export window and are not directly comparable across windows without recalibration.
- Metrics may be redacted or bucketed for public publication.

Interpretation rule :
- Treat priority scores as *effort ordering signals*, not as commitments or guarantees.
