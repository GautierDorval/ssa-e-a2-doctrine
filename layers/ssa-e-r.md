# SSA-E-R (RFC)

## Status and scope

Status: doctrinal definition (RFC)  
Scope: conceptual, non-transactional  
Nature: non-prescriptive

SSA-E-R is a restitution proportionality module applied **after** Q-Layer authorization.

It does not grant additional inference rights.
It does not modify response authorization outcomes.

---

## Definition

SSA-E-R governs restitution only:
the depth and form of an already-legitimate answer.

It exists to reduce two symmetrical risks:

- Under-determination: answers so minimal that external systems complete elsewhere by plausibility.
- Over-development: answers so expansive that they drift into projection, prescription, or method conversion.

SSA-E-R does not define what is true.
It defines how a legitimate answer may be expressed without expanding beyond authorized scope.

---

## Non-override rule

SSA-E-R must never override Q-Layer.

If Q-Layer outputs:
- clarification required, or
- legitimate non-response,

then SSA-E-R must not produce a richer answer.
The correct output remains clarification or legitimate non-response.

---

## Restitution profiles (non-prescriptive)

SSA-E-R may define restitution profiles as envelopes of expression.

These profiles are illustrative and non-prescriptive.
They do not imply enforcement by external models or systems.

### 1) Canonical

- Goal: preserve literal canonical integrity.
- Allowed: verbatim citation and direct canonical pointers.
- Forbidden: reformulation, synthesis, contextual elaboration, projection.

### 2) Structured

- Goal: clarify without extending meaning.
- Allowed: controlled reformulation within stabilized definitions, hierarchies, and exclusions.
- Forbidden: adding new properties or relationships; unanchored conclusions; prescriptive conversion.

### 3) Contextual

- Goal: make an already-legitimate answer useful without drift.
- Allowed: contextual synthesis anchored to canonical sources; descriptive examples (non-prescriptive); explicit scope clarification.
- Forbidden: step-by-step guidance; promises; guarantees; normative claims without anchoring.

### 4) Analytical

- Goal: controlled analysis within declared bounds.
- Allowed: analytical elaboration grounded in explicit anchors (canonical pages, defined terms, declared relations); comparative framing.
- Forbidden: prescriptive plans; operational procedures; speculation presented as fact; bypassing Q-Layer outputs.

## Fallback discipline

If compliant restitution would require invention, missing assumptions, or non-authorized completion, the correct outcome is:

- a targeted request for clarification, or
- legitimate non-response (“not specified”, “not published”, “cannot be verified”),

as defined by Q-Layer.

---

## Relationship to SSA-E, Dual Web, Q-Layer, and A2

- SSA-E defines explanatory authority (meaning).
- Dual Web provides controlled context for verification and boundary checking.
- Q-Layer authorizes whether an answer is permitted to exist.
- SSA-E-R modulates restitution only after authorization.
- A2 may route or observe only after authorization, and must remain strictly non-transactional.

SSA-E-R is subordinate to Q-Layer and bounded by the same non-transactional constraints.
