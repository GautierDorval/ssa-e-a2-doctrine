# Changelog

This changelog documents doctrinal evolution (conceptual changes), not performance changes.

## v1.3.1

- Maintenance and consistency hardening:
  - Aligned `CITATION.cff`, `links.json`, and this changelog with the current release.
  - Removed a duplicated section in `layers/q-layer.md` ("Traceability of non-actions").
  - Fixed a malformed Markdown code fence in `implementations/better-robots-txt.md`.
  - Expanded coverage of the doctrinal JSON-LD entity graph (`ssa-e-a2-dual-web-doctrine.jsonld`).
  - Added minimal CI to validate JSON/JSON-LD syntax, Markdown fence balance, and internal link integrity.

## v1.3.0

- Introduced SSA-E-R (RFC): a restitution proportionality module applied **after** Q-Layer authorization.
- Added `layers/ssa-e-r.md` and updated the doctrine narrative to include SSA-E-R in the layer stack.
- Updated the doctrinal JSON-LD graph to include SSA-E-R and set repository version to 1.3.0.

## v1.2.0

- Added Q-Layer as a transversal interpretative legitimacy layer.
- Introduced response authorization pattern documentation.
- Updated doctrine, terminology, and principles to incorporate legitimacy gating and legitimate non-response.

## v1.1.0

- Prior release (SSA-E + A2 + Dual Web).
