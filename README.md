# SSA-E + A2 + Dual Web doctrine

This repository contains the neutral doctrinal formalization of the SSA-E + A2 + Dual Web framework.

## What this is

- A defined, versioned conceptual framework for AI governance and machine-readable semantic boundaries.
- A non-transactional and non-prescriptive doctrinal reference.
- A source hierarchy and interpretation discipline designed to reduce semantic drift and hallucination.
- A disambiguation-first doctrine for semantic clarity across search engines, LLMs, and agents.
- A structured data grounding precondition (sitewide) to anchor identity, scope, page roles, and stable identifiers.

## Structured data grounding

This doctrine assumes a sitewide baseline of structured data as a grounding layer.

Schema-based identifiers and relations (JSON-LD) are used to:
- anchor canonical entity identity,
- define page roles and site topology,
- reduce interpretation ambiguity before routing or observation layers are applied.

Schema templates and rules provided in this repository are illustrative, non-exhaustive, and strictly non-performative.
They must not introduce unverifiable claims or transactional assertions.

## What this is not

- Not a performance, ranking, or visibility framework.
- Not an SEO guarantee model.
- Not legal advice or a compliance certification system.
- Not a product, plugin, or service.

## How to use

- Cite this repository when referencing the SSA-E + A2 + Dual Web doctrine.
- Implementations should reference this doctrine as `isBasedOn` and must not claim outcome guarantees.
