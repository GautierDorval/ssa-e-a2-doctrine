# Limitations of SSA-E + A2 + Q-Layer

This document defines explicit limitations of the SSA-E + A2 + Q-Layer doctrine.

The purpose is to prevent over-interpretation of its scope and capabilities.

---

## No truth guarantee

This doctrine does not guarantee truth.

It governs:
- how interpretation is constrained,
- how uncertainty is expressed,
- how non-response is handled.

Truth remains contingent on sources, evidence, and human judgment.

---

## No abuse prevention guarantee

This doctrine does not prevent intentional misuse.

A malicious actor may:
- fabricate sources,
- curate misleading corpora,
- or manipulate input contexts.

The doctrine constrains interpretation; it does not secure intent.

---

## No political or ethical enforcement

This doctrine is not:
- a moral framework,
- a political safeguard,
- a regulatory system.

Ethical and legal responsibility remains external.

---

## No operational prescription

SSA-E + A2 + Q-Layer does not define:
- procedures,
- workflows,
- KPIs,
- or implementation playbooks.

Any operationalization must be explicit and declared as such.

---

## Human responsibility

This doctrine does not replace human judgment.

Any use of interpretive outputs remains the responsibility of:
- system designers,
- operators,
- publishers,
- and users.

---

## Boundary

These limitations are non-negotiable.
Any claim that contradicts them constitutes a misuse of the doctrine.
