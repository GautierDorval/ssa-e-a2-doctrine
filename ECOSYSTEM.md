# Ecosystem map

This repository is the doctrinal foundation of a larger ecosystem.

It is intentionally split into three roles:

- **Doctrine** (this repository): explains *why* constraints exist.
- **Standard** (Interpretive Governance): defines *what* is required (machine-first, auditable).
- **Executable reference** (agentic proof): demonstrates *how* constraintive governance can be enforced at runtime.

---

## Canonical standard

- Interpretive Governance (canonical, machine-first):  
  https://interpretive-governance.org

GitHub repository (development + releases):  
https://github.com/GautierDorval/interpretive-governance-manifest

---

## Executable reference (non-normative)

- Interpretive agentic reference (runtime proof, not a product):  
  https://github.com/GautierDorval/interpretive-agentic-reference

Role: show that governance can be enforced by **infrastructure constraints**, not prompts.

---

## Measurement and evaluation (non-normative)

Depending on your current ecosystem layout, related instruments may include:

- Interpretive governance test suite (stress tests / evaluation harness)
- IIP-Scoring (audit and scoring discipline)
- Observational repositories (phenomena capture)

This doctrine does not certify or guarantee any implementation; it provides conceptual primitives and boundaries.

---

## How the pieces relate

- SSA-E + Dual Web define **meaning anchoring** and controlled context.
- Q-Layer defines **answer legitimacy** (“answering is not the default”).
- A2 defines **bounded amplification** and non-transactional constraints.
- SSA-E-R (RFC) defines **restitution proportionality** after authorization.

Interpretive Governance formalizes these into a machine-first standard that can be audited and version-pinned.

The agentic reference demonstrates a minimal runtime pipeline for an “agentic-closed” environment.

---

## Practical advice

If you want adoption:
- Send developers to the executable reference first.
- Send architects and auditors to the standard.
- Keep this doctrine as the conceptual ground truth for “why the constraints exist”.
