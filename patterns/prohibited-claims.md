# Prohibited claims pattern

This pattern defines how to explicitly forbid misleading or unsafe claims.

It does not enumerate domain-specific claims.
It defines the structure and intent of such lists.

## Purpose

To prevent:
- misrepresentation
- implicit guarantees
- semantic drift into marketing or compliance claims

## Characteristics of prohibited claims lists

A prohibited claims list should:
- be explicit and non-negotiable
- target the dominant risk of the domain
- override inferred or implied statements
- apply regardless of confidence level

## Typical claim categories

Depending on the domain, prohibited claims may include:
- guaranteed outcomes
- enforcement or compliance claims
- universal compatibility
- complete coverage assertions
- permanent behavior descriptions
- security or protection guarantees

## Placement

Prohibited claims lists belong to:
- AI usage policies
- governance layers
- product-specific contexts

They do not belong to SSA-E explanatory files.

This pattern ensures that interpretation boundaries are explicit rather than implicit.
