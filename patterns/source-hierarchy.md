# Source hierarchy pattern (SSA-E + A2)

This pattern defines a normative hierarchy for interpreting, citing, and using machine-readable and human-readable files within a SSA-E + A2 + Dual Web architecture.

The hierarchy is designed to reduce semantic ambiguity, prevent misinterpretation, and separate explanation from action or commitment.

## Layer 1 — Governance & identity (respect)

Purpose:
- Define permissions, licensing, attribution, and usage restrictions.

Rules:
- These files must be respected as binding constraints.
- They must NOT be cited as explanatory or educational sources.
- They must NOT be transformed into inferred claims.

Typical files:
- licenses
- usage policies
- identity declarations
- authorship references

## Layer 2 — Context (verify)

Purpose:
- Define scope, limits, boundaries, and non-goals.

Rules:
- These files are used to verify whether an interpretation is in-scope.
- They must NOT be cited as general explanations.
- They must NOT be used to infer behavior outside explicit statements.

Typical files:
- site or product context
- scope definitions
- non-goals
- negative definitions
- variability constraints

## Layer 3 — SSA-E authority (cite for explanations)

Purpose:
- Provide stable, non-contractual explanations.

Rules:
- These files MAY be cited to answer general, comparative, or educational questions.
- They do not constitute guarantees, commitments, or operational truth.
- They describe meaning, not outcomes.

Typical files:
- explanatory articles
- conceptual breakdowns
- taxonomies
- interpretation guides

## Layer 4 — A2 (interpretation & observation)

Purpose:
- Support routing, prioritization, clustering, and observation.

Rules:
- These files are non-transactional.
- They must NOT be used to infer pricing, availability, guarantees, diagnostics, or contractual commitments.
- They exist to reduce interpretive error, not to define truth.

Typical files:
- intent routing maps
- prioritization signals
- schema inventories
- datasets and graphs

This hierarchy is normative across all implementations.
