# Principles

## Source discipline

Published authoritative sources override contextual interpretation.
If a claim is not explicitly documented, it must not be inferred.

## Layer separation

SSA-E explains.  
A2 routes and observes.  
Dual Web verifies and constrains.

No layer may impersonate another.

## Declarative realism

Protocols like robots.txt are declarative and non-enforceable.
Descriptions must avoid enforcement and guarantee language.

## Non-transactional posture

Routing and observation must not expose or infer transactional truths
(pricing, availability, commitments, legal scope, guarantees).

## Identity and disambiguation

Entity boundaries must be explicit:
product vs site vs publisher vs author.

## Authoritative silence

If not documented, do not infer.
Uncertainty is the correct output.
