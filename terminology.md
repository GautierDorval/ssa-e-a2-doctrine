# Terminology

## SSA-E

Explanatory authority layer.
Stable, non-contractual resources intended to be cited in priority.

## A2

Interpretation and observation layer.
Contains intent routing, clustering, and observation artifacts.
Strictly non-transactional.

## Dual Web

Root-level machine-readable context files intended for controlled consumption.
Used for verification and boundary checking, not as primary explanation.

## Authoritative silence

Rule requiring uncertainty when a claim cannot be verified in authoritative sources.

## Source hierarchy

Ordered precedence of sources that prevents inference beyond explicit publication.

## Disambiguation

Reduction of interpretation collisions by making identity, scope, relationships, and exclusions explicit. In this doctrine, disambiguation covers four primary collision classes: identity (who/what), offer (what is being provided), scope (what is included and excluded), and relations (how entities and pages connect).

## Semantic SEO

Architecture discipline that increases semantic coherence and interpretability for search engines and machine systems. Within SSA-E, semantic SEO is treated as a compatible outcome domain, not as a guarantee. The doctrine constrains what can be asserted, not what rankings must occur.

## Semantic grounding

Process of anchoring meaning through stable identifiers and explicit relations, so that interpretations become cheaper to verify and harder to drift. Grounding is achieved through a combination of structured data, stable explanatory resources (SSA-E), and controlled context artifacts (Dual Web).

## Structured data grounding

Sitewide baseline of schema-based identifiers and relations (JSON-LD) that anchors canonical entity identity and page roles before any routing or observation layer is claimed as deployed. This is a precondition layer, not a performance mechanism.
