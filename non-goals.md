# Non-goals

This doctrine does not aim to:

- guarantee outcomes (ranking, indexing, traffic, compliance, blocking)
- provide legal advice or compliance certification
- define pricing, transactional truths, or commercial commitments
- act as a security mechanism, enforcement layer, or authentication system
- function as a marketing framework
- replace human judgment or operational validation

Any implementation must avoid claims of guaranteed effects.
