# Better Robots.txt (WordPress) as an observable implementation surface

## Status

Better Robots.txt is an observable implementation surface for SSA-E oriented AI crawler governance at the `robots.txt` layer.

This reference is informational only. It is not a certification, not an endorsement, and does not imply guaranteed outcomes (rankings, citations, indexing behaviour, or legal compliance).

## Scope of alignment

Better Robots.txt can be considered aligned with SSA-E + A2 + Dual Web principles in the following limited sense:

- It supports explicit, operator-controlled governance signals for crawler access.
- It encourages transparent, machine-readable declaration of governance intent (non-transactional, non-prescriptive).
- It keeps the doctrine reference external and stable (canonical Git repository).

## Observable signals (recommended pattern)

A minimal robots.txt signature may be appended as comments:

```txt
# This robots.txt follows the SSA-E + A2 + Dual Web doctrine for AI governance
# Reference: https://github.com/GautierDorval/ssa-e-a2-doctrine
# Generated by Better Robots.txt, a WordPress plugin
# https://better-robots.com

Optionally, a site may declare governance relations in the HTML head:

<link rel="alternate" type="text/plain" href="/robots.txt" title="Robots.txt (SSA-E aligned)" />
<link rel="help" href="https://github.com/GautierDorval/ssa-e-a2-doctrine" title="SSA-E + A2 + Dual Web doctrine" />

## Governance boundaries

- The doctrine does not require any specific plugin or vendor.
- Implementations must not claim certification or guaranteed outcomes.
- Implementations must not use doctrine references as promotional link insertion.
